Our Story - 

Once upon a time, in our college days, a group of us felt a tug at our hearts. We looked around and saw the Earth, our home, in trouble. Pollution, deforestation, climate change – it was all happening, and it scared us.

Name: Rushikesh Borude

Age: 22

Occupation: Software Engenering

So, we decided to do something about it. But where to start? We were computer science students, after all. Then it hit us: why not use our skills to create something that could make a difference?

And that's how "Save Earth" came to be. We sat down with our laptops and got to work. First, we brainstormed ideas – simple things everyone could do to help the planet. Then, we built a website to share those ideas with the world. Learn More...


Our Mission for Earth - 

Using Less, Wasting Less:

We're trying to use less stuff and throw away less. That means reusing things when we can and recycling what we can't use anymore.

Saving Energy

We're turning off lights and appliances when we're not using them. It's a simple way to save energy and help the planet.

Cutting Down on Plastic:

Plastic pollution is a big problem, so we're trying to use less plastic in our daily lives. We're saying no to single-use plastics like straws and plastic bags and choosing reusable alternatives instead.

Ocean and Water Protection - 

Champion the protection of oceans, rivers, and water bodies, combatting plastic pollution, overfishing, and habitat destruction through sustainable practices.

Green Innovation -

Drive innovation in green technologies, fostering advancements in renewable energy, eco-friendly transportation, and sustainable materials.

Raising Awareness About Plastic Pollution -

We're raising awareness about the detrimental effects of plastic on ecosystems. Encouraging the reduction of single-use plastics and promoting recycling programs helps prevent plastic waste from entering our oceans and harming wildlife.
